    <p>Question1.What is javascript?</p>
    <div>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose 
        implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
         It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. 
        JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.
         The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.<br>
         The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.<br>

         JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.<br>
         Designed for creating network-centric applications.<br>
         Complementary to and integrated with Java.<br>
         Complementary to and integrated with HTML.<br>
         Open and cross-platform</div>
    <p>Question2.What is the javascript run time environment?</p>
    <div>The runtime environment is what makes JavaScript code work, and in a browser in consists of the JS engine, a lot of Web APIs, 
        a callback queue and the event loop<br>
        The JS engine translates source code into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks at the hardware level.</div>
    <p>Question3.What is Execution Context?</p>
    <div>The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution.<br>
        During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable 
        byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.</div>
    <p>Question4.What is javascript Engine?</p>
    <div>A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, 
        but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance<br>
        JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript 
        engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model.</div>
    <p>Question5.What is the flow of data in engine?</p>
    <div>A data flow is a workflow specialized for data processing. Any system where the data moves between code
         units and triggers execution of the code could be called dataflow.</div>
