//Q.Min and Max
//Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array, you will easily be able to solve this.
function arrayMin(arr) {
   
    return Math.min(...arr);
   
 }
 console.log(arrayMin([3,1,4,6,2,7]));
 function arrayMax(arr) {
  
   return Math.max(...arr);
 }
 console.log(arrayMax([3,1,4,6,2,7]));
